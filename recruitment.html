  <h2 class="title-3 text-dark mb-3">CONSULTING TEAM LEAD</h2>
  <div class="service-content mb-4">
    <p>Each team lead manages a project team of 4-5 student consultants. Leads are responsible for organising meeting times, guiding team members, and directly contributing work towards completing engagements.
    <br><br>
    Each team will work on 1-2 engagements during the school year, but will - at most - work on 1 project at any specific time. Team leads can expect to commit an average of <strong>5-8 hours per week</strong> during engagements.
    <br><br>
    Teams will meet monthly with industry mentors, presenting work-in-progress documents to receive guidance and feedback. Leads will take charge in this process, ensuring that work is prepared for these meetings.
    <br><br>
    We are not seeking students from any particular discipline. Instead, we are looking for:
    <br>
    <strong>Leadership:</strong> You will manage the team’s performance, delegating tasks and ensuring that work is completed on time and to your standards.
    <br>
    <Strong>Strategy:</Strong> You will control the direction of the project. Team leads must analyse problems, identify root causes, and synthesise solutions. 
    <br>
    <Strong>Commitment:</Strong> Your actions set the standards and expectations for your team. As much as possible, we will ensure that workload is manageable e.g. having teams only work on one engagement at any specific time.
    <br><br>
    Team leads greatly influence the quality of work that we deliver to clients, in turn underpinning the social impact that we generate. If you’re looking to learn about consulting, contribute to our community, and sharpen your leadership skills, apply now!
